                <p>A team of researchers led by Chandan Sen at the Indiana University 
                    School of Medicine, is moving a new nanochip device, which can reprogram skin cells in the body to become new blood vessels 
                    and nerve cells, out of the prototype phase.</p>

                <p>The IU team's approach is to forgo the laboratory 
                    and turn the human body into its own cell programmer 
                    using a technology called tissue nano-transfection. 
                    This uses a silicon nanochip that has been printed to 
                    include channels ending in an array of micro-needles. 
                    On top of the chip is a rectangular cargo container, 
                    which holds specific genes.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, doing this requires complicated 
                    laboratory procedures, and, along with many 
                    alternatives, can raise certain risks, including 
                    giving rise to cancerous cells.</p>
