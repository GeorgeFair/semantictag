	<h1>Ice Breaker</h1>

	<h2>Equilibrium</h2>

	<h2>Why Are Glaciers melting?</h2>
	<p>
		Glaciers and sea ice are shrinking because the planet is warming
        Rising greenhouse emissions, rising global temperatures, and melting ice are all connected.
        Warmer ocean water melts glaciers from below, while warmer air speeds surface melting. Less snowfall
        also means less ice is being added to glaciers.

	<h2>What We Can Do</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Cut fossil fuels in exchange for cleaner energy alterntives</li>
		<li>Improve home efficiency with better insulation, and energy smart appliances</li>
		<li>Support policies and companies that invest in renewable power.</li>
		<li>Protect forests and wetlands that store carbon.</li>
		<li>Stay informed and support policies that act on climate science.</li>
