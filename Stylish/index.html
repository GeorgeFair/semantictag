	<h1>Ice Breaker</h1>

	<h2>Equilibrium</h2>

	<h2>Why Are Glaciers melting?</h2>
	<p>
		Glaciers and sea ice are shrinking because the planet is warming: rising greenhouse gas emissions
		trap more heat, which drives air and ocean temperatures up, disrupts long-term climate patterns,
		and accelerates melt faster than winter snow and ice can rebuild.
	</p>

	<h2>What We Can Do</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Cut fossil fuel use by choosing clean electricity, public transit, and efficient vehicles.</li>
		<li>Improve home efficiency with better insulation, smart thermostats, and energy-smart appliances.</li>
		<li>Support policies and companies that invest in renewable power and rapid emissions cuts.</li>
		<li>Protect forests and wetlands that store carbon and buffer coasts from rising seas.</li>
		<li>Stay informed and vote for leaders who act on climate science and climate justice.</li>
	</ul>
